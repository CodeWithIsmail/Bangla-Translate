BanglaLens is a Flutter-based text recognition and translation app designed to help users capture or upload images and extract text. The app utilizes Google ML Kit for text recognition and translates extracted English words into Bengali using an integrated translation service. It allows users to crop images, view recognized text, and see word pairs (English and Bengali meanings) displayed in a user-friendly interface. Users can also copy extracted text to the clipboard and benefit from offline functionality for consistent access to translations. The app ensures smooth user interaction with gallery/camera image selection, text extraction, and translation.
